## 💌 Inspiration

As someone with too many hobbies, I often struggle with how to spend my after-work hours. I’ve leaned on dice, lists, and random generators to guide me, but most are purely functional and lack the warm, intentional feel I wanted for my space.

So I’m building **Cozy Randomizer** for myself (and for anyone else who needs a little spark of softness to accompany their decision-making rituals)!

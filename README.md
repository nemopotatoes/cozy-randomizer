# 🎮 Cozy Randomizer [WIP]

**Cozy Randomizer** is a soft, aesthetic web-based generator that takes any user input — whether it’s a list, a thought, or a mood — and returns either a single randomized result or a gentle sequence of them. It's designed to be a cozy little companion for decision-making, creative prompts, or mindful breaks.

## 🌼 Features
- 🎲 Randomly pick a single result from a list
- 🧵 Generate a sequence of results
- ✏️ Minimal, distraction-free UI
- ☁️ Cozy aesthetic 
- 🔒 All local — no data stored

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## 🗺️ Planned Roadmap

This is a small personal project — features may grow slowly over time ~

## 💌 Inspiration

As someone with too many hobbies, I often struggle with how to spend my after-work hours. I’ve leaned on dice, lists, and random generators to guide me — but most are purely functional and lack the warm, intentional feel I wanted for my space.

So I’m building **Cozy Randomizer** for myself (and for anyone else who needs a little spark of softness to accompany their decision-making rituals). ✨
